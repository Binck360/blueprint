JavaScript API

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-danger pt-icon-error">
  <h5>Original `Tabs` API is deprecated since v1.10.0</h5>
  The original `Tabs` API has been deprecated in v1.10.0 favor of the simpler and more flexible
  `Tabs2` API described below. Documentation for the deprecated components can be found
  [further below](#components.tabs.deprecated). The deprecated components will be removed in v2.0.
</div>

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-primary pt-icon-info">
  <h5>Advantages of new API</h5>
  - Only two components (`Tabs` and `Tab`) are needed, rather than the previous four.
  - Selection is managed by ID, rather than by index. This is more reliable and deterministic and
    does not require translating between numbers and tab names. It does, however, require that
    every `Tab` have a locally unique `id` prop.
  - Arbitrary elements are supported in the tab list, and order is respected. Yes, you can even
    insert things _between_ `Tab`s.
</div>

The `Tabs2` and `Tab2` components are available in the __@blueprintjs/core__
package. Make sure to review the [general usage docs for JS components](#components.usage).

```
import { Tab2, Tabs2 } from "@blueprintjs/core";

<Tabs2 id="types">
    <Tab2 id="fruits" title="Fruits">
        <h1>A list of fruits</h1>
    </Tab2>
    <Tab2 id="grains" title="Grains">
        <h1>A list of grains</h1>
    </Tab2>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />
</Tabs2>
```
